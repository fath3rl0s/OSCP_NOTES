Looking through files does not lead to much however lookig for services listening has led to a discovery

==Port 5432== - Listening locally on the host on not visible externally

Addresses `0.0.0.0` , `*` , and `[::]` indicate that a port is listening on all interfaces, meaning that it is accessible externally, as well as locally, which is why we were able to detect both the FTP service on port 21 , as well as the SSH service on port 22

#### ==SSH Tunneling==

[[Visuals.canvas|Visuals]]



The SSH protocol is vastly used for maintaining and accessing remote systems in a secure and encrypted way. But, it also offers the possibility to create tunnels that operate over the SSH protocol. More specifically, SSH offers various types of tunnels

There are some potential workarounds involving uploading static binaries onto the target machine to exploit, however, an easier way to bypass this roadblock is by a practice called ==port-forwarding, or tunneling, using SSH .==


==`ssh -L 1234:localhost:5432 christine@10.129.228.195`==

We can also send this tunnel to the background in order to keep working within the same shell by using `-f` and `-N` switches:

==`ssh -L 1234:localhost:5432 christine@10.129.228.195 -f -N`==

#### **PostgreSQL**

==`psql`==
#tools 
CLI tool to interact with PostgreSQL
Using ==**psql**== , we can now interact with the PostgreSQL service running locally on the target machine.

We make sure to specify localhost using the ==`-h`== option, as we are targeting the tunnel we created earlier with SSH , as well as port 1234 with the ==`-p`== option, which is the port the tunnel is listening on.

==`psql -U christine -h localhost -p 1234`==
