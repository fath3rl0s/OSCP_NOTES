- Add IP and domain name to `/etc/hosts`

- Enumerate subdomains `x.thetoppers.htb` 

Often, different subdomains will have different IP addresses, so when our system goes to look up the subdomain, it gets the address of the server that handles that application. It is also possible to have one server handle multiple subdomains. This is accomplished via "host-based routing", or "virtual host routing", where the server uses the Host header in the HTTP request to determine which application is meant to handle the request.

awscli has got another feature that allows us to copy files to a remote bucket.

try uploading a PHP shell file to the S3 bucket and since it's uploaded to the web-root directory we can visit this webpage in the browser, which will execute this file and achieve remote code execution.
