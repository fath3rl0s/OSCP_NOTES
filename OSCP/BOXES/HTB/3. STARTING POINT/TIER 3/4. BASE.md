This appears to be upside down. Run strings again and save to a file.

This file checks the username/password combination that the user submits against the variables that are stored in the config file (which is potentially communicating with a database) to see if they match.


The developer is using the strcmp function to check the username and password combination. This function is used for string comparison and returns 0 when the two inputted values are identical, however, it is insecure and the authentication process can potentially be bypassed without having a valid username and password.

This is due to the fact that if strcmp is given an empty array to compare against the stored password, it will return NULL . ==In PHP the `==` operator only checks the value of a variable for equality, and the value of NULL is equal to 0 .==

The correct way to write this would be with the === operator which checks both value and type. These are prominently known as "Type Juggling bugs"

In PHP, variables can be easily converted into arrays if we add [] in front of them

Adding [] changes the variable $username to an array, which means that strcmp() will compare the array instead of a string.

If we convert those variables into empty arrays ( $username[] & $password[] ), the comparison will return NULL , and NULL == 0 will return true, causing the login to be successful.
