Potential User Account Discovered
![[Pasted image 20240729161034.png]]

This seems interesting - No Vuln output due to lack of API token.

Lets get one by registering with WPScan
![[Pasted image 20240729161717.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240729162029.png]]
(Dont get cheeky, This key has been destroyed)

Now scan with API Key:
```
sudo wpscan --url http://tenten.htb --random-user-agent --max-threads 10 --enumerate --api_token $WPAPI
```

**IDOR**
==Insecure Direct Object Reference==
(IDOR) are a type of access control vulnerability that arises when an application uses user-supplied input to access objects directly


What we find interesting is the plug-in associated with the job manager 
![[Pasted image 20240729163137.png]]


Navigating directly through the browser leads to a security researchers LinkedIn profile which I believe is the guy responsible for the discovery.

```
https://vagmour.eu/cve-2015-6668-cv-filename-disclosure-on-job-manager-wordpress-plugin/
```



Running the url through `google.com` shows an exploit

Grab Exploit
![[Pasted image 20240729164034.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240729164613.png]]

This code seems to be discovering an uploaded content image and giving us access to potentially confidential information.

So we need to find the name of image to supply to the tool...
***

Navigating around the site reveals some kind of file upload associated with job management

```
http://tenten.htb/index.php/jobs/apply/8/
```
![[Pasted image 20240729164743.png]]


If there is a Object reference vuln, we may be able to pull down sensitive information from previously submitted resumes!

The Job Application field may be taking in resumes and uploading using the field name
***
**SCRIPTING**

Alright, we can use `curl` here to pull down the front end code of the URL from before
![[Pasted image 20240729170005.png]]

What we want to know is how the `Job Application` field changes

We can formulate a simple parsing tool to isolate for the `Job Application` field result like so:
![[Pasted image 20240729170143.png]]


Now use `cut` to further parse
```
curl -s http://tenten.htb/index.php/jobs/apply/8/ | grep -i entry-title | cut -d ">" -f 2 | cut -d "<" -f 1
```
![[Pasted image 20240729170225.png]]


Changing the object reference number produces different results. We could manually test but this could be wasted time so lets automate!

***
**Create For Loop in BASH**

The object number is the target in this URL
Take the previous `curl` command and ask BASH to iterate using a sequence from 1-25 and `echo` each iteration thats passed to the `curl` command
```
 for i in $(seq 1 25); do echo -n "$i"; curl -s http://tenten.htb/index.php/jobs/apply/$i/ | grep -i entry-title | cut -d ">" -f 2 | cut -d "<" -f 1; done
```

This reveals a hidden page!
![[Pasted image 20240729170624.png]]

So now we must couple our finding with the exploit from earlier
![[Pasted image 20240729170954.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240729171108.png]]

Pull down the tool and investigate with `strings` `file` and `exiftool`
![[Pasted image 20240729171946.png]]

Nothing but we can also try `steghide`
![[Pasted image 20240729172140.png]]

```
seghide --info HackerAccessGranted.jpg
```
![[Pasted image 20240729172208.png]]

We find an embedded `id_rsa` file (private key) inside this image

Extract:
```
steghide extract -sf HackerAccessGranted.jpg
```
![[Pasted image 20240729172701.png]]

Seeing as the private key is encrypted, we will not be able to use it to ssh until we either crack the encryption or brute force the password (we also need `600` permissions on the file)
![[Pasted image 20240729173110.png]]

***
**SSH2JOHN**

Before we can use john the ripper to crack, we need to convert this file to a readable format for john to understand

Search teh entire filesystem for anything `2john` related ( this are the various john the ripper tools used to convert files to a readable format for john to crack)

```
sudo find / -iname *2john* -type f 2>/dev/null
```
![[Pasted image 20240729174025.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240729174136.png]]

```
python /usr/share/john/ssh2john.py id_rsa
```
![[Pasted image 20240729174710.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240729174722.png]]

```
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt id_john.txt
```

**Priv Escalation**

I immediately run `sudo -l` for privilege misconfiguration and find a peculiar file named `fuckin`
![[Pasted image 20240729175356.png]]


Running the file as is, with `sudo` does nothing...
![[Pasted image 20240729175446.png]]
I figured it would be a binary and an unreadable file considering its location until I inspected the file with the `file` command

Considering its a script, I opened in `vim`
![[Pasted image 20240729175652.png]]

Its a simple script that accepts 4 arguments
So I supplied `/bin/sh` as argument 1 with `sudo` priv and obtained root

It may be possible to Brute-Force this page using default credentials but Im not too interested in this as it usually leads to a dead-end
