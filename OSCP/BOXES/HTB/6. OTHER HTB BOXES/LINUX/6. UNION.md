Lets supply an input to check the server response
The hope is to influence its behavior in some way that benefits us 

We find it has reflected our input

![[Pasted image 20240730191143.png]]


Click on the here link to navigate to `http://10.10.11.128/challenge.php`
![[Pasted image 20240730191401.png]]
Supplying another random input returns nothing

***

Navigate back to the initial page but this time supply a different value
![[Pasted image 20240730191717.png]]

Interesting - It filtered the input and returned a lowercase `b`


Always check for SQLi when presented with a form but lets also run `feroxbuster` and `sqlpmap` in the background

#TTP 
`T1190 Initial Access: Exploit Public Facing Application`


**Feroxbuster**
```
 sudo feroxbuster --auto-tune --extract-links --random-agent --extensions php --output /tmp/union.derox --threads 60 --url http://10.10.11.128/ --wordlist /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-small-words.tx
```

**SQLMAP**
Grab POST Request from Player Eligibility page in Burp to use the `-r` switch
![[Pasted image 20240730193214.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240730192814.png]]


Create a new file with POST contents
![[Pasted image 20240730193014.png]]


Start Building SQLMAP command
```
sudo sqlmap -r union.txt
```


Set Risk and Level to max values
(In a real test you would start much lower and increase depending on ROE - Rules of Engagement)
![[Pasted image 20240730193358.png]]


Set BATCH - Use default behavior
![[Pasted image 20240730193626.png]]


DUMP
![[Pasted image 20240730193814.png]]

```
sudo sqlmap -r union.txt --level=5 --risk=3 --batch --dump
```

![[Pasted image 20240730200139.png]]

Timeout error but we do get MYSQL Version and indication of vulnerability (We knew sqlmap would not be able to properly enumerate this machine)



Lets continue to probe the web server

***

So, can we find a way to discover any accounts that maybe are not eligible? Maybe someone who is already qualified or registered. Maybe the creator of the machine?

Check the creator in HTB
![[Pasted image 20240730194311.png]]


Try `ippsec`
This means he is already in the back-end database
We can try a few SQL payloads with this information
![[Pasted image 20240730194057.png]]


Navigate to Burp and send this request to Repeater
![[Pasted image 20240730194522.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240730194554.png]]


Lets start by manually injecting this form with SQL
add a tick to the input
![[Pasted image 20240730195126.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240730195143.png]]


It takes the input as a new player - Escaping may be harder than we thought


```
ippsec`-- -
```
![[Pasted image 20240730195325.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240730195341.png]]

SO this `ippsec` is identical
```
ippsec`-- -
```
to the Web Application

The web application is being told to ignore anything after the backtick in hopes of preventing SQLi

The dashes were also not returning in the response 


Modify
![[Pasted image 20240730201049.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240730201101.png]]



Another point of interest is the removal of the `challenge.php` link.
It seems the SQL query has removed it whenever we get a successful message

***

**SQL**
High level logic

```
SELECT username
FROM users
IF username="x"
```
`x` being the attacker controlled variable


If you ever suspect SQLi but cant trigger, you can use the `UNION` keyword that retrieves information from other tables

Allows you to execute additional queries but the two queries must have the:
1. same number of columns (Order By Clause)
2. matching data types
