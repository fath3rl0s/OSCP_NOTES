Uploading a rev php webshell fails
![[Pasted image 20240723153432.png]]

Navigate to Browse and inspect Kali.iso file 
![[Pasted image 20240723153511.png]]


I grabbed a valid torrent file from Kali and uploaded in hopes of editing

![[Pasted image 20240723154006.png]]

It takes a minute but then we see the option to edit

Editing allows you to change the file image and only allows image formats

**Linux-Exploit Suggester**

Let's instal and run this tool for priv esc vectors
https://www.kali.org/tools/linux-exploit-suggester/
![[Pasted image 20240724144532.png]]

Serve to victim and run
![[Pasted image 20240724144816.png]]


This program does a great job of listing potential exploits from most critical to least.

For this reason, let us work our way down starting with the `full-nelson` exploit. (I saw `dirtycow` referenced a few times during research. It is listed second - might be worth a shot after)

**FULL-NESLON**

Check to see if we have `gcc` installed on the machine
![[Pasted image 20240724145507.png]]
Great! 
I typically like to run gcc on the native machine if possible to avoid updated compilation protections on the attacking machine.

Serve exloit and compile code on victim
Then Run

**DIRTY COW** 
Failed but could be because of gcc on victim machine
This could be explored more because it should work

**PAM MOTD** 
FAILED but is referenced in the Guided Section
