```
The website specifically mentions the usage of the {{json .}} formatting template, which renders all the information about the container in the JSON format. Thus, we can use {{json .}} as the format argument required by the docker-inspect argument of the script. To read the JSON output conveniently, we can use jq to parse the JSON output into a readable format. jq can be installed using the following command, however, it is already present on the target machine.
```



`sudo /usr/bin/python3 /opt/scripts/system-checkup.py docker-inspect '{{json .}}' 960873171e2e | jq`

Inspect code:

Line 47 references a script with a relative path. This can be exploited by creating a malicious file with the same name because it looks for `full-checkup.sh` in the *current working directory
