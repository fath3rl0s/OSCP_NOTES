**LTRACE**

`ltrace ./baby`

BREAKDOWN:

The `ltrace` command is used to trace library calls made by a program and to report the calls that were made along with their arguments and return values. In this specific example, `ltrace` is used to observe the library calls made by the executable `./baby`.



- ==**First Line==: `puts("Insert key: "Insert key:) = 13`**:
    
    - **Function Call**: `puts("Insert key: ")`
    - **Description**: The `puts` function is called to print the string "Insert key: " to the standard output.
    - **Return Value**: `= 13` indicates that the `puts` function successfully printed the string and returned the value 13 (the number of characters printed).
- ==**Second Line==: `fgets(password "password\n", 20, 0x7f141c5ef8e0) = 0x7ffee29cd3f0`**:
    
    - **Function Call**: `fgets(password, 20, 0x7f141c5ef8e0)`
    - **Description**: The `fgets` function is called to read a line of input from the standard input (usually the keyboard) and store it in the buffer `password`.
    - **Arguments**:
        - "password \\n": The input string that the user provided, which is "password\n".
        - `20`: The maximum number of characters to read (including the null terminator).
        - `0x7f141c5ef8e0`: The file pointer from which to read, typically `stdin`.
    - **Return Value**: `= 0x7ffee29cd3f0` indicates the address of the buffer where the input was stored.
- **Third Line: strcmp("password\\n", "abcde122313\\n") = 15`**:
    
    - **Function Call**: strcmp("password\\n", "abcde122313\\n")
    - **Description**: The `strcmp` function is called to compare the input string "password\\n" with the expected string "abcde122313\\n".
    - **Arguments**:
        - `"password\n"`: The user-provided input string.
        - `"abcde122313\n"`: The expected correct string.
    - **Return Value**: `= 15` indicates the result of the comparison. In this case, `strcmp` returns 15 because the strings are not equal (non-zero return value means they differ).
- **Fourth Line: `puts("Try again later."Try again later.) = 17`**:
    
    - **Function Call**: `puts("Try again later.")`
    - **Description**: The `puts` function is called to print the string "Try again later." to the standard output.
    - **Return Value**: `= 17` indicates that the `puts` function successfully printed the string and returned the value 17 (the number of characters printed).
- **Final Line: `+++ exited (status 0) +++`**:
    
    - **Description**: This indicates that the program exited with a status code of 0, which typically means that it terminated successfully.
