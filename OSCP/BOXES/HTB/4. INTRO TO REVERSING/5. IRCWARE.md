**GHIDRA**

When searching through the code, we want to find the end goal, the logical point in the code where we can have our password accepted to reveal the flag

From there we work backwards to meet the conditions to get to that stage of the code:

It may help to work out what some of the `syscall()` are doing, rename functions to make it more human readable, and comment out some of the code.

**SYSCALL() Mapping**
Linux Sys call tables:
https://blog.rchapman.org/posts/Linux_System_Call_Table_for_x86_64/
- Map syscall() to whatever value is in the ==%rax register==

Lets take the first syscall in the entry function:

![[Pasted image 20240617182205.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240617182233.png]]


We see that `0x13e` is being moved ,`MOV`, into the `%RAX`:

![[Pasted image 20240617182418.png]]

In x86-64 assembly, registers have specific roles in different contexts, especially during system calls. When analyzing assembly code and determining which register is used, it is essential to understand the conventions and instructions used.

Understanding Registers in x86-64 Assembly

- **`EAX` vs. `RAX`**: In x86-64 assembly, `RAX` is the 64-bit version of the `AX` register. The `EAX` register is the lower 32 bits of the `RAX` register. So, any operation on `EAX` implicitly affects the `RAX` register.
    
- **System Calls**: In x86-64 Linux, system calls are made using the `syscall` instruction. The system call number is placed in the `RAX` register before the `syscall` instruction is executed.
    

Assembly Instruction Analysis

When you see an instruction like `MOV EAX, 0x13E` just before a `syscall`, this is how it translates:

1. **`MOV EAX, 0x13E`**:
    
    - This instruction moves the value `0x13E` (which is 318 in decimal) into the `EAX` register.
    - Since `EAX` is the lower 32 bits of `RAX`, this effectively sets the value of `RAX` to `0x13E`.
2. **`syscall`**:
    
    - This instruction triggers the system call with the number currently in `RAX`.

This particular `syscall()` taking in a random number from the kernel

So, `RSI` (ESI) is taking in count of characters (4) as a value and `RDI` (is specificing which characters - 0000

This becomes the NICK username for IRC

Select `syscall()` in decompiler, type `;` for commenting
![[Pasted image 20240617183523.png]]

***
Lets jump into the next function to analyze the `syscall()`

![[Pasted image 20240617183643.png]]

This Function has 2 `syscall()`
![[Pasted image 20240617183718.png]]

The first `syscall()` is taking in the value of `0x29` into the `%rax`
![[Pasted image 20240617183824.png]]

The second takes in `0x2a`
![[Pasted image 20240617184450.png]]

REFERENCE SYSCALL TABLE:
![[Pasted image 20240617184519.png]]

This program is opening a socket and making a connection.

Comment 
![[Pasted image 20240617184755.png]]

***
Lets move onto the next function for analysis:

![[Pasted image 20240617184937.png]]

We find a `syscall()` that essentially writes
![[Pasted image 20240617185026.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240617185046.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240617185058.png]]

RENAME FUNCTION:
Highlight and hit `l`

![[Pasted image 20240617185220.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240617185232.png]]

The last 2 `syscall()` write and abort
![[Pasted image 20240617185433.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240617185446.png]]

***
Ok so we know that this program opens and established a socket but where? 

Go back to the establish_connection function (I renamed from earlier where the syscall() opens and connects a socket)
![[Pasted image 20240617191843.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240617191828.png]]

We find these values being Pushed to the connect `syscall()`
![[Pasted image 20240617192025.png]]
This is actually the IP and Port but not in the right format. 
![[Pasted image 20240617192738.png]]
Convert because of Little Endian Format with CyberChef
Use Change IP Format from Hex to Dotted Decimal
![[Pasted image 20240617192429.png]]
This is still not correct
Add a zero to the Hex
![[Pasted image 20240617192341.png]]

And now we have the internal IP 127.0.0.1 in Little Endian Format

Swap Endianness
![[Pasted image 20240617192550.png]]

For the Port use From Base
![[Pasted image 20240617192820.png]]

Look Familiar? Add Swap Endianness
![[Pasted image 20240617192845.png]]

**127.0.0.1:8000**

So this program connects to locahost on port 8000, hence the Abortion Warnings when we ran this earlier
***

RUN the program with a listener on 127.0.0.1:8000

![[Pasted image 20240617214921.png]]

Note the different usernames each time we run

Try runnning `PING :` IRC Command as seen in previous file inspection

***

The strings command previewed some interesting commands and if wee go back into the main function, we can see these IRC commands again

![[Pasted image 20240617215451.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240617215542.png]]




![[Pasted image 20240617215529.png]]

`PRIVMSG #secret :@flag`
Returns a "Reuqires Password" message

![[Pasted image 20240617215729.png]]


And using 
`PRIVMSG #secret :@pass poasword`
![[Pasted image 20240617215954.png]]

So we have noow hit a wall but have found the point in the code we need to investigate further. 

Lets use GDB
***
**GDB-PWNDBG**

![[Pasted image 20240617221405.png]]

```
r2
aa
afl
```

This shows us the entry function which we can go into

```
s entry
pdf
```

![[Pasted image 20240617221531.png]]

```
^C
^D
```

***
Lets find break point in Ghidra to use in GDB

Find the Comparison `CMP` and look for the Jump Zero `JZ`

![[Pasted image 20240617221858.png]]

Grab the address of `JZ`
`40039e`

Set Break Point in GDB:
`break *0x40039ee`
![[Pasted image 20240617222114.png]]

Start NC again and run the program
`run`

![[Pasted image 20240617222218.png]]


Now try entering the password command again
`PRIVMSG #secret :@pass password`

![[Pasted image 20240617222430.png]]

Breakpoint reached

Use `n` to step through to the next sections, looking for comparison

![[Pasted image 20240617222705.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240617222738.png]]

Look at the address in Ghidra for the comparison and an interesting string

![[Pasted image 20240617222853.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240617222920.png]]

Looks like `JJ3DSCP` is being compared to our password stringg

We can also see where the program is taking each character of `password` and making a comparison. 

![[Pasted image 20240617223248.png]]

So we can check what is being stored in `$al`

```
p $al 
p/x $al - HEX
p/c $al - Character
```

![[Pasted image 20240617223402.png]]

Stepping through all the way to the `ret` triggers the rejection. It never makes it past the very first letter `p` when making the comparison

![[Pasted image 20240617223824.png]]

***

Back to Ghidra

Lets navigate to the `Accepted` section

![[Pasted image 20240617224218.png]]

Now look for the portion just after the check but before the Accepted portion.

We can jump there in GDB

![[Pasted image 20240617224304.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240617224321.png]]
***

`jump *0x40044a`

![[Pasted image 20240617224408.png]]

Try Printing the flag and presented with this:
![[Pasted image 20240617224807.png]]

Seems to be a jarbled or encrypted flag

***
Ok, Back the Ghidra
![[Pasted image 20240617224956.png]]

This function essentially makes sure that bVar3 is all upper case letters in HEX

![[Pasted image 20240617225146.png]]

And then substract 9

So if we take this value `RJJ3DSCP`, we can use CyberChef to decipher the ROT13
![[Pasted image 20240617225320.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240617225703.png]]

```  
if (((0x40 < bVar3) && (bVar3 < 0x5b)) && (bVar4 = bVar3 + 0x11, 0x5a < bVar4)) {
bVar4 = bVar3 - 9;
```


The provided code snippet appears to be performing a transformation on an ASCII character, specifically using a variant of the ROT13 (ROT9) cipher for uppercase letters. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of how it works:

- **Character Range Check**:
    
    - `0x40 < bVar3 && bVar3 < 0x5b`:
        - This checks if `bVar3` is within the range of uppercase ASCII letters ('A' to 'Z').
        - In ASCII, 'A' is 0x41 (65 in decimal) and 'Z' is 0x5A (90 in decimal).
- **ROT13-like Transformation**:
    
    - `bVar4 = bVar3 + 0x11`:
        - Adds 0x11 (17 in decimal) to the character value `bVar3`.
        - This is similar to the ROT13 transformation but with a shift of 17 instead of 13.
    - `0x5a < bVar4`:
        - Checks if the resulting value `bVar4` exceeds the ASCII value for 'Z' (0x5A).
- **Wrap-around Logic**:
    
    - If `bVar4` exceeds 'Z', it wraps around using `bVar4 = bVar3 - 9`.
        - This ensures the transformation stays within the uppercase letter range.
