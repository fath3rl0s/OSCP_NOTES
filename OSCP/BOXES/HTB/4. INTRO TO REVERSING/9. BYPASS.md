codebase was written in .NET and so C#

We will need to use the 32-bit version for debugging

Set Breakpoint at line 11 just before the `if (flag2)` conditional

Function `1()` is where we are prompted for user input:
![[Pasted image 20240619102805.png]]
*Function always returns false*



Run Program
`Solution for this problem was to change the value of flag2 on the fly, and so we set a breakpoint before the if check executed and changed the value of flag2.`

Change `flag2` to be true in order to step through to the next function

Function `2()` prompts for a secret key

Set a breakpoint and run

```
In function 2() we got prompted for a secret key (lines 36-37 in figure 6), and that secret key got compared to a specific value. If the secret key was equal to the given value then true was stored in flag, if not, false was stored in flag.

Working off the assumption that we had to find the value which would store true in flag, we got to work.

Thanks to our trusty breakpoint in line 39 we saw that the value which we were comparing our input against was “ThisIsAReallyReallySecureKeyButYouCanReadItFromSourceSoItSucks”
```

***
The program kept closing before I could see the flag


Add breakpoint
