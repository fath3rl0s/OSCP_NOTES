At the end of the first block, we see it calling ptrace() and checking if the result is -1 . If this is true, the binary prints Well done!! and exits

***

ptrace() article that explains this program can understand when it is being debugged

https://seblau.github.io/posts/linux-anti-debugging

![[Pasted image 20240614152318.png]]

if run in debugger, puts(Well done) is triggered!and exit the program



Right before "No Flag" - We have a CMP (comparison function)

![[Pasted image 20240614153226.png]]

0x539 in Hex is 1337
![[Pasted image 20240614153433.png]]

Comparing 1337 with `[RBP + local_24]`

Scroll up

![[Pasted image 20240614153616.png]]

So we need to be able to pass the correct parameters to create a true condition

![[Pasted image 20240614153722.png]]

to jump to this next chunk of code

![[Pasted image 20240614153807.png]]

We also see that some code is unreachable
![[Pasted image 20240614154142.png]]


Wee can change this with Edit -> Tool Options -> Decompiler -> Analysis -> Uncheck 'Elimate unreachable code'


![[Pasted image 20240614154115.png]]


Now we have more code
![[Pasted image 20240614154339.png]]

Grab offset and enter **PWNGDB**

`info functions`

Because the program is stripped, we can not see the main()

We can however, user radare to interact with it

```
r2
aa
afl
```

![[Pasted image 20240614155930.png]]

```
s main
pdf
```

![[Pasted image 20240614160021.png]]

We can grab offsets and breakpoints moving forward

`^C`
`^D`

As we have no solid break points we can use

`starti` to run program and stop at first instruction

![[Pasted image 20240614160717.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240614160731.png]]

RUN `piebase`

![[Pasted image 20240614160826.png]]

Jump to the offset `1525`

![[Pasted image 20240614160938.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240614161012.png]]


`breakrva 0x14f4`

![[Pasted image 20240614161154.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240614161207.png]]


`continue`
Stops at JNZ - Jump Not Zero
![[Pasted image 20240614161328.png]]


Essentially wee do not want it to continue to the first conditional statement that will print "Well Done"

![[Pasted image 20240614161528.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240614161606.png]]


We want to Jump to 1525 instead

![[Pasted image 20240614161652.png]]

Grab the 1525 address again and jump to it
`jump *0x555555555525`
